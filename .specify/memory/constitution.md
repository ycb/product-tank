# Product Tank Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centric Design
Every feature must solve a real user problem with measurable impact. User research and feedback drive all product decisions. Features without clear user value are not built.

### II. Data-Driven Decisions
All product decisions must be backed by data, metrics, or user research. Assumptions must be validated through experimentation. Success metrics must be defined before feature development begins.

### III. Iterative Development
Build, measure, learn cycle is mandatory. Features are released as MVPs and improved based on user feedback. No feature is considered "complete" - continuous improvement is expected.

### IV. Technical Excellence
Code quality, performance, and maintainability are non-negotiable. Technical debt must be tracked and addressed. All code must be tested, documented, and reviewed.

### V. Security & Privacy First
User data protection and security are fundamental requirements, not afterthoughts. Privacy by design principles must be followed. Security reviews are mandatory for all features.

## Additional Constraints

- **Performance**: All features must meet performance benchmarks (page load < 2s, API response < 500ms)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required for all user-facing features
- **Browser Support**: Support for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with graceful degradation
- **Mobile Responsive**: All features must work seamlessly on mobile devices

## Development Workflow

- **Code Review**: All changes require peer review and approval
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests required for all features
- **Documentation**: API documentation and user guides must be updated with each release
- **Deployment**: Automated CI/CD pipeline with staging environment validation

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require:
1. Documentation of the change rationale
2. Impact assessment on existing features
3. Team consensus and approval
4. Migration plan for any breaking changes

All PRs must verify compliance with constitution principles. Complexity must be justified with clear business value. Use this constitution as the foundation for all product and technical decisions.
